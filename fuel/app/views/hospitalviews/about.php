          of computer science is constantly growing as she is eager to learn. She has experience working
          in an industry setting with two summer internships at Webroot Cyber Security where she interned
          under a product owner working with Salesforce and Oracle teams. Originally born in the bay area
          of California, her family moved to Colorado when she was a young age to pursue their love for
          the skiing and the outdoors. She loves plants, pugs, and painting and despises being cold.
